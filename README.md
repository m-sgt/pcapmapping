<h1>Known Issues</h1>
Currently there are no known bugs associated with this program!<br><br>
<h1>Roadblocks Overcome</h1>
Enabling the program to determine the public IP address associated with the device it is currently running on was something I had not yet tried before. After researching possible methods to achieve this goal, I chose to query the open source API provided by httpbin.org which allows the program to establish the client's public IP address for mapping purposes.<br><br>
